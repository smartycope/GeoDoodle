 *
 * This is main.
 *
 * Suggested features:
 * fix the "d" key bug
:) add a button that shows all the keys and what they do
:) hide the mouse when you press the arrow keys
:) add a button that hides/gets rid of the metalines
:) switch the 'c' key and the space key - didn't like it, switched back
 -   added it to settings
:) expand and center the dots array so it goes off screen better
 * consider moving the enter key to some other key - add to settings?
:) add smaller dots within the dots so repeating can actually work
 * fix it so when a line runs out of the original area, it cuts it
 *   off where is ends, but still draws it.
 * add zooming in and out
 * add a camera you can move around
:) add saving (i.e. serialization and deserialization)
 * add saving to a pdf
 * make the repeater area smarter (i.e. make the area
 *   more closely follow the lines, not just in a square)
 *   Maybe have it (somehow) recognize if it's a tesselation, and
 *   then have an x and a y setting pop up to specify the overlap.
 *   Perhaps have different kinds tesselation presets?
 * allow screen resizing
 * add mirroring
:) add instant repeating inside of the metabox (toggles with m)
 * add the ability to change how much space is between the dots
 * add middle click button = X
 * consider changing the name "GeoDoodle" to "The Tesselator"
