bind the mirror QActions

specify a key repeat
set up a settings file (Im pretty sure theres a Qt class for this)


undo undos too many/too few lines after mirror is changed -- maybe use indecies instead of a buffer?

add the ability to add text like in LTSpice
bind ctrl+y to redo

fix all the menus -- put in a text or ui file

zooming
flipping
add different dot formations
filling spaces
repeating only across a specific axis
add mouse middle click dragging do translation
Allow the focus go offscreen properly
add curves
AUTO_IMPRINT_PATTERN doesnt quite work yet, and the pattern colors dont work either

file extensions arent automattic
consider making mirror use patterns instead of hand mirroring all the lines
add a rotation option to Pattern.params
add a seperate shortcut to just delete the selected area and not copy it
the toolbar (file, edit, view thing bar) is grabbing focus I think
mirroring has an off-by-one error somewhere that makes it so you cant touch those lines
make shift when not being dragged toggle the current bound
holding shift while moving with the arrow keys works, but doesnt let go until one move after you let go of shift
change clipboard to use the actual clipboard via JSON
if you hold down a number key, it triggers to change the color of that button
add some sort of shortcuts to bring up the basic lines and/or basic chords
just go through and play with it and fix or note any bugs that come up
saving broke
adding a preferences menu
add an option to make clearAll reset the mirror or not
figure out how to get the docks to work on the side
a custom line editor (for custom pens)
grabbing pattern isnt working right, possibly something to do with mirroring
space and c stop working at random points, until you click the pattern, not sure why, something grabbing focus maybe?

Pair/Point could probably be optimized away from solely using floats
