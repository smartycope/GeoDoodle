#GeoDoodle

GeoDoodle is a graph paper like doodler program. You can draw out patterns, mirror them, and repeat them across the screen. Then you can load, save, or export your pattern. It's a fairly simple idea, and it's a fairly simple program, but it's actually a lot of fun to play around with when you're bored.

I first wrote it in C++ on top of the freeglut API, because it was my first semester of college and I was excited about this cool idea that I had and I could actually do it. Freeglut was what my assignments that semester used, so I just hacked that code, not really knowing what I was doing. Someone really needs to write new assignments for that class.

I then came back to the project about a year later, after starting many other projects, and knowing way, way more. I also had discovered python, God's gift to programmers. I ended up scrapping the entire codebase, and rewriting the entire thing from scratch in python, and to get roughtly where I was before, took me about 4 hours. It was pretty cool. I then added a bunch more features and made everything a lot nicer (pygame is an excellent API), including adding menus and options and a better repeating system. I eventually got stymied by the GUI's though. At that point I hadn't really done much with GUI's, and tried using pygame-gui, which isn't a bad API, it's just really not meant for what I wanted, and ended up writing huge, very nasty wrappers around their classes and it just wasn't worth it.

A couple months later, I had the idea to use Qt It was something I'd wanted to learn for a while, but I never really had a project suited to it, until I realized this was perfect. Turns out, Qt is freaking FANTASTIC. I love it. There's a reason it's so popular. It definitely takes getting used to, but it's all very clean, and QtCreator is absolutely fantastic. I hate having to manually position UI items in code. Using Qt allowed me to expand even further, and add more features far more intuitively. 

That's where I'm at right now. I have plans to use pyqtdistribute or whatever it's called to make it into an android app, which would just be so cool. But I want to get the whole thing to a more stable state before I try that.
