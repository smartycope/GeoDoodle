* Bugs to Fix:
   the q/middle click bug
   make fullscreen work so it's using the better function
   add a checker in home/end so that dot spread can't reach 0 (0r like, less than 5)
   arrowkeys get out of sync with the dots if dotspread is changed without ignoreMouse moving
   make lines scale with the dots
   menu x button makes it so you can't reopen that menu
   you have to press within the menu at least once to get it to recognize any button clicks -- hack fixed
   check if a line is identical to another line so it won't get double dark
   b (bounds key) doesn't set properly when using only arrow keys
   the preview pattern in the repeat menu doesn't get the x/yAmount based on the offset
   if you save a pattern and open it later in a bigger window, it's not going to be big enough
   fix the sliders so when you press their left or right buttons, they only move one value (or a parameterized value)
        (maybe catch the event and process it myself by calling the 'set value' function?)
    switch the labels in the ui element classes to use uilabels instead of uitextboxes.


Features to extend:
   add dynamic width and height to image saving
   The gui can certainly be optimized a lot
   add a dark theme option checkbox 
   add the ability to exclude a specific line when repeating by erasing it in the repeat menu
   add single horrizontal mirroring
   undo (especially with mirroring) gets desynced easily. Make undo and redo tuples to hold all the previous actions?
   make the GUI element positions relative to the size of the window, but have them cap off at a certain value
   add a button that saves the previewed pattern in the repeat GUI without having to leave the menu
   anti-alias exported images
   add a "keep original pattern" button to the repeat gui


Features to add
    add zooming in
   have mouse scrolling change the line color
   all the menus
   hide the mouse when the ignoreMouse is true
   add a setting to optionally have the mouse hidden all the time and only show the focus
   add a metabox somehow?
   add repeating
      have a key specify the points, and have circles around the specified points
   add the ability to color in areas inbetween the lines
   add copy and paste functionality (select with the bounds box maybe?)
   add an option that lets you put a picture as the background?
   


 * maybe have the repeater (somehow) recognize if it's a tesselation, and then have an x and a y setting pop up to specify the overlap.
    - Perhaps have different kinds tesselation presets?
 * allow screen resizing
 * add mirroring
    - 2x, 4x, 8x?
 * consider changing the name "GeoDoodle" to "The Tesselator"
 * area selector with the mouse (specifically for an eraser)
 * add capability to use more (or less) than 4 enters to select and area
 * add different shapes to repeat (repeat within a square, triangle, hexagon, etc.)
    - add an option to choose which
 * add lines showing the current progress of the enters area
 * add different colors
    - the ability to color in areas between lines
      - use a recursive function that reads pixels from the surface!
    - be able to change line colors
 * be able to end (and maybe start?) a line along a different line 
    - use a modifier key to be able to do such
 * add automatic dynamic tesselation repeating
    - add an option to turn it on or off
 * added a button that hides the metalines

#* THINGS TO ADD
    # add repeating
    

    add fancy repeating (with a menu)
    maybe add a failsafe in case it's fullscreen and everythings stopped
    add an options to make shift home/end jump more?
    add mirroring (2x, 4, 6x, 8x...)
    have lines scale with dotSpread
    add settings menu gui
    add half spacing with shift arrow keys
    create an algorithm that randomly generates patterns
    add a redo function, and have it include erasing an entire pattern
    add the ability to, when you push a button, end a line along another line, and have the focus reflect that
    add colors (attached to keys? make a toolbar?)
    add sharing?
